This project is a version of the classic Snake game developed using a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The design ensures a clean and maintainable code structure. The game features efficient data handling through the use of arrays and linked lists, optimizing in-game performance. Additionally, it includes an AI feature that uses queues and breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms to make optimal decisions autonomously.
